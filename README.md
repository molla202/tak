Ping Explorer is a light explorer for Cosmos-based Blockchains.  https://ping.pub .

## What is the difference between Ping explorer and other explorers? 

Ping Explorer is designed to explore blockchain data as real as possible, therefore there is no cache, no pre-processing. Ping Explorer does not cache/save blockchain data on its server. Ping Explorer only fetch data from Cosmos full node via LCD/RPC endpoints. We call it "Light Explorer".

## Do you want to list your blockchain on ping.pub?

Pull your request [here](./src/chains), We will add your chains as soon as possible. It is **FREE** (You must have 10+ independent validators on your chain).

## Why Ping explorer use official/trusted third party public LCD/rpc server? 

We have two considerations: 

 - Trust, In decentralize system, everything controlled by one single team/organization could be risks. So we decided to co-build with the community. 
 - Limited Resources: ` Ping Dashboard ` will list hundreds cosmos-based blockchains in the future, it's impossible for our team to run validators or fullnodes for all of those chains.
